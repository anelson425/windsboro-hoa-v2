The Windsboro Homeowners Association consists of 220 homes located between Langsford Road and 50 Highway just west of Blackwell Road. We have a convenient location with easy highway access, close proximity to parks, libraries, excellent shopping and great local restaurants. Our resident students attend Leeâ€™s Summit High School, Pleasant Lea Middle School and Highland Park Elementary. The beautiful homes of Windsboro are surrounded by acres of green space accented by 5 ponds. Our neighborhood swimming pool is a favorite summer gathering place. It is also home to Windsboro Waves a recreational summer swim league. More information on Windsboro Waves on the pool page.

The association is run by numerous volunteers and we are always looking for more help. If you are interested in helping, please reach out to the general inbox at: {{< general_contact>}}
