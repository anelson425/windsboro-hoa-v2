We have a convenient location with easy highway access, close proximity to excellent shopping and great local restaurants. Our resident students attend Leeâ€™s Summit High School, Pleasant Lea Middle School and Highland Park Elementary. The beautiful homes of Windsboro are surrounded by acres of green space accented by 5 ponds. Our neighborhood swimming pool is a favorite summer gathering place. It is also home to Windsboro Waves a recreational summer swim league. More information on Windsboro Waves on our amenities page.
