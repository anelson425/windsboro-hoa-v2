### Swim Team
Thank you to all neighborhood volunteers who make our pool a great place to spend your summer here at Windsboro. As a reminder the pool is open daily from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm. Please do not bring glass into the pool area. Guests are to be accompanied by a Windsboro resident. Windsboro Waves is a recreational summer swim team open to all kids 6 to 18 who live in the Highland Park Elementary attendance area. The season runs from Memorial Day through mid-July and includes daily weekday morning practices at the Windsboro pool and weekly swim meets against other L.S. subdivision teams. Practices and meets focus on stroke refinement and improving endurance in a fun, supportive team environment. Registration begins in April.
