The 5 ponds in Windsboro add much beauty and wildlife to our community. The Pond Committee will continue to evaluate all available measures to maintain the appearance and quality of the ponds including maintenance of dam structures, outlet structures, embankments and sediment forebay cleaning. Several of the ponds have a variety of fish species ( catch and release only), turtles and other wildlife for the enjoyment of all Windsboro residents.
